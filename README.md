# Early-Depression-Detection

Depression usually occur as a result of adverse life events such as losses of a significant person, object, relationship or health but it can also occur due to no apparent cause.

Oxford dictionary defines depression as "A mental condition characterized by severe feeling of hopelessness and inadequacy typically accompanied by a lack of energy and interest in life"

This project tries to use data to understand and classify depression states, detect the onset of depression, understand the sleep patterns of depressed and non-depressed individuals, predict MADRS score based on motor activity.

Early detection is vital for rapid intervention, which can drastically reduce the escalation of the disorder. Major Depressive Disorder affects more than 400 million people world wide particularly women. Using social network data such as twitter, reddit, facebook, this project aims to detect negative sentiments and report early cases of depression.
